Kubernetes (commonly stylized as K8s[4]) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.[5] It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".[6] It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.[7] Many cloud services offer a Kubernetes-based platform or infrastructure as a service (PaaS or IaaS) on which Kubernetes can be deployed as a platform-providing service. Many vendors also provide their own branded Kubernetes distributions. Kubernetes (κυβερνήτης, Greek for "helmsman" or "pilot" or "governor", and the etymological root of cybernetics)[6] was founded by Joe Beda, Brendan Burns, and Craig McLuckie,[8] who were quickly joined by other Google engineers including Brian Grant and Tim Hockin, and was first announced by Google in mid-2014.[9]
